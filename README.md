# Offset Resizer

**Offset frames, components and component sets by a uniform distance from their contents.**

Offset Resizer is for when you have a frame you want to “Resize to fit”, but you also need a margin. It works on frames, components and component sets.

**NEW – We've added an option to set the left & right margin independently**

## How to run Offset Resizer

Offset Resizer is keyboard operated:

**→** Select the frame (or frames) you want to resize.

**→** Type `⌘` + `/` to open Figma’s quick actions search bar (or `Ctrl` + `/` if you are on Windows).

**→** Start typing “Offset” to search for and run the plugin.

**→** Enter the offset you want to apply, or select one of the preset values.

**→** Hit `Enter` to run the plugin, or `Tab` to enter a separate left & right margin.
